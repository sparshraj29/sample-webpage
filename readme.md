# Sample Website

This is a simple website project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic web development concepts, including structuring a webpage with HTML, styling with CSS, and adding interactivity with JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
2. **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the webpage, making it look visually appealing.
3. **script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity, allowing the user to change the text on the page by clicking a button.

## Features

- A welcoming heading (`<h1>`).
- A paragraph of text that can be dynamically updated.
- A button that, when clicked, changes the text of the paragraph.
- Basic styling to make the website look clean and modern.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sample-website.git
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   bash
   cd sample-website
   
3. **Open the `index.html` File in Your Browser**:
   - You can open it directly by double-clicking the `index.html` file, or right-click and select "Open with" your preferred web browser.
   
4. **Interact with the Website**:
   - Click the button to see the text change!

## Code Overview

### index.html

The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the webpage:
- It includes a container with a heading (`<h1>`), a paragraph (`<p>`) with an ID of `text`, and a button with an ID of `changeTextBtn`.
- The CSS and JavaScript files are linked within this file.

### styles.css

The `styles.css` file styles the webpage:
- Sets a light background color and centers the content.
- Styles the text, making the heading bold and the paragraph slightly gray.
- Adds hover effects to the button to improve user experience.

### script.js

The `script.js` file adds functionality:
- An event listener is added to the button, so that when clicked, it changes the text content of the paragraph.
